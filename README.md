**DESCRIPTION OF TASK WHAT I HAVE DOEN :

This project demonstrates how to solve a real-world business optimization problem using Linear Programming (LP) and Python’s PuLP library.We modeled a scenario where a factory produces two products — Product A and Product B — using two machines with limited daily operating hours. The objective is to maximize profit by determining the optimal number of units to produce for each product, without exceeding the available machine time.Using PuLP, weDefined decision variables (number of units to produce),Formulated the objective function (maximize total profit),Added constraints (machine hour limitations),Solved the model and extracted meaningful business insights.**
